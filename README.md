## Add-ons

* [ffmpeg exporter](https://github.com/motion-canvas/exporters) - Export mp4 directly from MC.

* [Motion Canvas Camera](https://github.com/ksassnowski/motion-canvas-camera) - A camera component for Motion Canvas that allows you focus on elements, move the camera, follow paths and much more. (But also see [#328](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas/issues/328) where it is being discussed to integrate with base MC)

* [Motion Canvas Component Library Template](https://github.com/hhenrichsen/motion-canvas-component-library-template) - A template repo that brings in some of the standards of Motion Canvas to allow easily making component libraries for Motion Canvas.

## Examples

(not just intentional examples, but just other animations using MC to learn from)
